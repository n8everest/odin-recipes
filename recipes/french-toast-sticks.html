    <p>An essential for every Breakfest meal are these delicious savory French toast.
    Made with a rich egg custard flavored with cinnamon and vanilla that's soaked into 
    the bread, these toast are always a hit on every Breakfest platter. They have a soft texture
    on the inside but comes with the crunchiness on the outside!</p>
  <h2><strong>Ingredients</strong></h2>
    <ul>
      <li>4 thick slices white bread, preferably stale</li>
      <li>2 eggs</li>
      <li>1/4 cup milk</li>
      <li>Salt</li>
      <li>1/3 cup white sugar</li>
      <li>1 tsp cinnamon powder</li>
      <li>3 tbsp butter</li>
      <li>Maple syrup to serve (optional)</li>
    </ul>

      <h2><strong>Steps</strong></h2>
       <ol>
        <li>Remove crust of each slice, then cut each into 3 equal thick batons.</li>
        <li>Combine the eggs, milk and a pinch of salt in a bowl large enough 
         to roll the bread sticks in.</li>
        <li>Combine the cinnamon and sugar on a plate.</li>
        <li>Melt 2 tbsp of the butter in a large pan over medium high heat.</li>
        <li>Roll the sticks in the egg mixture quickly (do not soak them), 
           shake off excess and place in pan. Cook in 2 batches.</li>
        <li>Turn to cook each side until golden.</li>
        <li>Immediately transfer to the plate with the cinnamon sugar   
          and roll to coat. It's important to do this quickly while 
          they are hot straight out of the pan so it sticks.</li>
        <li>Melt remaining butter and cook the remaining french toast sticks.</li>
        <li>Serve immediately with maple syrup to dunk the sticks in.</li>
        
        <h2><strong>Recipe Notes</strong></h2>
       <ol>
        <li><p>Cut the slices thick enough so when you cut the crusts off then cut into 3 batons, 
          the slices are thick, square batons about 1.7 cm / 2/3" thick.</p> 
        
           <p>French toast is best made using stale bread. Fresh bread soaks up too much egg mixture, 
            making it soggy on the inside and your sticks will flop when you pick them up.</p></li>
          
        
        
        <li>It is best to use a loaf so you can cut thick slices as the thicker the sticks are 
            (and the staler the bread is), the stiffer the sticks are 
            (ie. they won't flop when picked up using fingers).</li>
